## Lighthouse Report Storing

### When and with what naming convention?

It is advised that when you complete an action in the testing environment and wish to submit it to be considered in the main Thoth Tech Art Gallery
Repository that you do a report to show as evidence of the improved score on the Lighthouse Report.

Example in reports: art-gallery-lighthouse-mobile-report-V40503-after-meta-description.pdf

Standard naming convention:
art-gallery-lighthouse-desktop-report-V1032023.pdf (project-type-report-version date)
art-gallery-lighthouse-mobile-report-V1032023.pdf (project-type-report-version date)

This way we can track actions the Lighthouse team have suggested and identify changes that have impacted scoring based on our standard report versions.
Advise to run reports monthly and/or after significant product changes
