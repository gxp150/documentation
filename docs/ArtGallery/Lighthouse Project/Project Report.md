### Goals/Objectives

[ ] Identify SEO Techniques and/or other front end testing tools that could be used in addition to Lighthouse (Adrienne has completed additional reporting and is uploading document to GitHub)

[ ] Compile Report outlining findings and action points derived from this (Commenced action points)

[ ]  What is Outstanding - Handover Tasks in GitHub/Trello

This will achieve the following deliverables:

Cleaner platform, minimising errors (technical and cosmetic), improving overall look and feel of website increasing companies brand.

### DDGIT Website

Our first task, we will need to locate or document website site map, create an excel file that we can use to document our findings for each page. We will need comparisons for how it is displaying in different web browsers and devices. We can collaborate on this excel file in Teams but less work if we can add it to GitHub and then our contributions will be tracked as was mentioned in class today.
### Project Status - 30 March 2023

We have created our first round of Lighthouse Reports and need to submit to GitHub
We have noted some enhancements for the front-end and improvements for the back-end using our reports and industry knowledge. We have touched base with our client to confirm our direction and progress. Our team is moving forward with work on Analysing the report and identifying how these can be implemented in Thoth - Art Gallery. These improvements are primarily surrounding naming conventions, optimisation, image scaling, creation of a site-map.


### Lighthouse Action Points
[ ] SiteMap being created by Adrienne Gelbhaur
[ ] Lang-en to page headers (<html> element does not have a [lang] attribute) â€“ have implemented on index page, pending merge
[ ] Rollover actions
[ ] Optimise Images (plus width/height and alt tags), have uploaded optimised image to replace existing, pending merge and update html
[ ] Naming convention for Link names (Links do not have a discernible name)
[ ] Document Meta details (Document does not have a meta description)
[ ] CSS Action Items (meta theme, start_url, splash screen)
[ ] Apple-Touch-Icon

### SEO Considerations
